## Install

## Usage

## Documentation

Visit the [Storybook](https://aagam-jodhpur.github.io/tailor-react/)

## Known issues

### Dual canvas in react strict mode

Disable react strict mode until this is fixed.

### Types not available

Due to issues in the build pipeline, type declarations can not be generated.

This will be fixed soon.

### Storybook is laggy

After visiting the example of the component with textures applied, the storybook will begin to lag and slow down.

This is not a problem with the component library.
This is a problem with the Storybook framework.

A fix has neither been determined nor planned.
